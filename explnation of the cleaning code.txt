
 Explanation of the Code:


1. Loading the dataset:

The pd.read_csv() function loads the dataset from the CSV file.
Handling missing values:

2. For the Age column, missing values are filled with the median age of the dataset (df['Age'].median()).
The Cabin column is dropped entirely since it has many missing values.


3.Output:

The original and cleaned datasets are printed.
The cleaned dataset is saved to a new CSV file (titanic_cleaned.csv).
Result: Cleaned Dataset
After running the code, the cleaned dataset will look like this:

Name	Age	Ticket
John Smith	25	347082
Mary Johnson	30	349909
William Brown	45	A/5 21171
Linda White	38	PC 17599
James Green	30	113803
Emma Black	30	373450
Missing ages have been replaced by the median age (30).

The Cabin column has been dropped.
